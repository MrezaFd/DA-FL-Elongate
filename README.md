## Problem Statement

The National Library of Indonesia (Perpusnas) emphasizes the importance of literacy, yet Indonesia faces a significant challenge with low reading interest. The government's initiative to increase literacy includes the establishment of libraries, but there's a need to explore the relationship between reading interest and library facilities.

## SMART Problem Statement

**Objective:** Identify 2 or more variables significantly influencing the Society Literacy Development Index (SLDI) in Indonesia.

**Method:** Conduct Exploratory Data Analysis and Regression Analysis by the end of June.

**Expected Outcome:** Provide at least 3 actionable recommendations based on SLDI and Level of Reading Interest data analysis.

## Project Goals & Success Metrics

### Project Goals

1. **Insights:** Provide an overview of Indonesia's literacy, focusing on Level of Reading Interest (LRI) and SLDI.
2. **Recommendation:** Offer actionable recommendations for improving literacy based on significant factors identified in the analysis.

### Success Metrics

1. Project proposal completed within 7 days.
2. Data dashboard displaying literacy conditions across 7 main islands.
3. At least 3 charts in the data dashboard for easy visualization.
4. Identification of 2 variables significantly influencing Indonesia’s literacy.
5. Submission of all required capstone project materials within approximately 2 months.
